Titanic Survival Prediction Model

📄 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. 
The data is sourced from the Kaggle competition 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster', and the analysis follows the CRISP-DM framework
 to ensure a structured approach.

🛠 CRISP-DM Framework Steps

1. Business Understanding

    Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

    Success Criteria: Achieve at least 80% accuracy while maintaining a balance between precision and recall.

2. Data Understanding

    Dataset includes features like Pclass, Age, Fare, Sex, and Embarked.

    Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and feature correlations.

3. Data Preparation

    Handled missing values using median imputation.

    Managed outliers by capping for Age and log transformation for Fare.

    Engineered new features such as FamilySize, IsAlone, and extracted Title from the Name column.

    Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

4. Modeling

    Built a RandomForestClassifier model.

    Achieved 83.8% accuracy on the test set.

    Evaluated the model using:

        Confusion Matrix

        Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

        ROC Curve with an AUC of 0.90

5. Evaluation

    The model performed well, showing balanced precision and recall.

    The ROC Curve indicated a strong performance with a high True Positive Rate and low False Positive Rate.

6. Deployment (Optional)

    Future steps include exploring deployment options using Streamlit or Flask for building a simple web app.

Key Learnings & Challenges

    Learned the importance of following a structured framework 
    (CRISP-DM).

    Understood the impact of outliers and the effectiveness 
    of feature engineering.

    Gained insights into model evaluation metrics and interpreting the ROC Curve.

🚀 Next Steps

    Experiment with different models like Logistic Regression, 
    SVM, and XGBoost.

    Implement hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

    Explore cross-validation to validate the model robustness.
